# How we AI
A handbook to how B12 integrates and talks about AI

Table of contents
  - **[Support communication](support.md)**. How do we communicate AI-powered features in support articles, in particular to highlight benefits while underscoring limitations and potential risks?
  - **[Marketing communication](marketing.md)**. How do we describe the features in a customer newsletter in a way that's both enticing and realistic?
  - **[Product communication](product.md)**. What microcopy do we embed in the product to quickly communicate considerations and potential gotchas?
  - **[Internal communication](experts.md)**. How do we share these tools with copywriting experts whose roles and expectations may change because of the technology?
  - **[Limitations](limitations.md)**. What examples of bias and other issues have we identified in our AI-powered tools?
  - **Evaluation (*coming soon*)**. How do we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate a new model and experience before its release to understand its limitations and identify some of its biases?
  - **Prototyping (*coming soon*)**. What is our approach to building AI-powered prototypes, and how do we mature these prototypes into customer-facing features?
