# Communication

In this chapter, we provide verbatim examples of how we communicate AI-powered functionality to several stakeholders:
  * First, from a support perspective, we show how we communicate the functionality to customers,
  * Second, from an internal perspective, we show how we communicate the functionality to people like copywriters, whose roles and responsibilities are affected by this technology,
  * And finally, we describe how we think about product microcopy to inform new-to-AI users who might not be aware of its limitations.

We haven't yet written marketing copy around this functionality we're treading carefully as we introduce the technology, but as we do, we'll include examples of newsletters and other marketing-oriented content in this chapter as well.
