# Examples of limitations
In no particular order, B12 wishes to thank:
* Several B12ers for prototyping the initial tools that resulted in this handbook.
* Aditya Bharadwaj and Shreya Bamne for outlining our initial evaluation procedures.
* Shreya Bamne, Aditya Bharadwaj, Katelyn Gray, Daniel Haas, and Adam Marcus for performing our first model evaluation.
* Aditya Bharadwaj and Adam Marcus for writing portions of this handbook.
* B12 copywriting experts and customers who used early versions of the product experience.

We are also thankful to the people who created the foundation models on which most of this work relies:
* The human labelers and curators who assisted in tuning and refining the models, sometimes [at great personal cost](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/).
* The content creators whose materials were used in training the models.
* The researchers and engineers that designed and built the models.
