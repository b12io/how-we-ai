## Slack announcement to copywriting experts

Hello @channel! We're excited to announce the first version of AI-based text generation in the B12 Editor. This is the first of what will be many such announcements as we get your feedback and iterate, and you should take it as an early prototype that will help support your creativity and save you time, but also have some rough edges. Here are the details:
* See the attached video for a demo
* Any rich text box in the editor from blog posts to services to email marketing now has the text generation lightning bolt enabled, and after filling in some prompts, our AI will generate text for you!
* For blog post outlines, paragraphs, and emails in particular, we have special-purpose generators that will create those specific types of text.
* **If you use these tools for a customer, you MUST critically review, fact check, and edit the generated text.** The models powering this tool are susceptible to various biases (e.g., gender and race). They generate text rather than facts, so you have to check the text they generate. By virtue of being trained on text from the web, they might generate text that's similar to other content, so you should also vet (e.g., with Grammarly) that the text isn't plagiarized. Finally, while we haven’t seen the model we’re using generate inappropriate-for-work text we ask that you tell us if you’re exposed to anything you perceive as inappropriate.
* Our v1 is powerful, but not compared to what it will be. We've got a number of upcoming features planned like long-form blog post generation and special-purpose text generation for services and about copy.

We believe that while these tools can help spark creativity and will likely save you time, they will not replace a copywriter. As these tools mature, copywriters can expect to spend more time editing and researching and less time writing the initial drafts. As we better understand the effects of these tools on copywriter efficiency, we'll share what we learn with you.
Thank you to *<list of team members>* for review and feedback on the first version of this tool. We're actively seeking out feedback, **so send me a message if you use the tool**. We'd love to speak with you in a paid feedback session.

*<transparency note: this is the video we released with the announcement, but the interface has since changed>*
