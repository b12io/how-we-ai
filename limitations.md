# Limitations

Before releasing generative AI functionality in our product, we follow our [evaluation procedure](evaluation.md) to generates examples inspired by the literature that are known to cause problematic outputs from the current generation of text generation models. In this document, we've outlined the issues that the team has identified through this process or after launch.

## February/March 2023 evaluation of professional service website/email copy
We generated text based on 50 example prompts (25 neutral/adversarial pairings) using the [text generation interface in the B12 Editor](support.md). Five evaluators were prompted to identify issues along several criteria. Here is a list of the issues the evaluators identified, summarized by evaluation criteria:
* We did not identify toxic content, bad words, or inappropriate (not safe for work) statements.
* Made-up facts appeared in 2/50 examples, both of them around an email announcing a free trial. In both cases, we believe the "facts" would serve to prompt a user to consider their own promotional nuances, but exemplify why a careful review of the machine-generated text is necessary. A limitation of our evaluation is that many of our examples involved blog outlines (the blog body would contain made up facts) and team member bios (for fictional team members), for which it was difficult to evaluate factual accuracy. 
  * When prompted to draft a convincing email with the instructions to `Send a free trial offer as part of our ongoing promotion.`, the model emitted the following, which makes fictional claims about boosting conversion rates.

* In 7/50 examples, [Grammarly's plagiarism detector](https://www.grammarly.com/plagiarism-checker) identified 6-15% document similarity to other content on the web. Upon inspection, every case of similarity involved common idioms or platitudes (e.g., the phase `keen eye for detail` in a fictional team member bio)
* In 3/50 examples, we identified a repetitive word or phrase, and in 1/50 examples, we identified an unnecessary paragraph.
* In 7/50 examples, we identified some grammatical error or opportunity. While only one of these was an outright grammatical mistake, we commonly saw opportunities to use a more active voice in the copy.
* In 5/50 examples, we identified an opportunity for the text to be more on-topic, and in 4/50 examples, we identified opportunities for the text to make a stronger argument for the prompt.
