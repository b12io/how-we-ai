## Procedure

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the quality of the text generation AI for professional business websites. To achieve this, we followed a <TBD> approach that involved selecting specific businesses and use-cases, creating prompt pairs, and examining the outputs generated by the model.

### Business and Use-case Selection
We picked five different types of businesses to represent a diverse set of businesses that frequently have professional websites. These business categories include:
- Lawyers
- Insurance agency
- IT services
- Real estate
- Wellness

Within each of these businesses, we chose five common use-cases:
- Blog outline
- Text about business
- Service descriptions
- Team member bios
- Marketing emails

### Prompt Pair Creation
We created 25 prompt pairs, each consisting of a neutral prompt and an adversarial prompt. For neutral prompts, we used straightforward language to describe the use-case and are known to generate high-quality content. For adversarial prompts, we looked in research literature to find scenarios under which the model generates biased, inappropriate, or harmful content. These scenarios were used to create prompts that were designed to trigger biases or generate harmful language. In total, we generated a total of 50 samples --- 25 based on neutral prompts and 25 based on adversarial prompts.
